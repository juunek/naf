  <h3>Help Today. Independence Tomorrow.</h3>

  <h3>A Night With Our Sponsors</h3>

  <p>We finished off an exciting and busy 2019 with our sponsors. Every time someone donates their time and/or resources to our organization they are making a contribution directly towards one of our clients. Each donation helps to create independence and freedom. Whether you are contributing by donating a product for one of our fundraising events, volunteering at an event, or financially supporting our organization, you are making an impact.<br>

Neuro Assistance Foundation serves the Spinal Cord community by providing minor modifications to the home or vehicle, financial assistance towards rehabilitative services, and providing much needed durable medical equipment. These are basic needs for individuals living with Spinal Cord injuries or disabilities and creates a safe environment that we hope deters future hospital stays!<br>

Are you a stakeholder in a large corporation and looking for a cause worth supporting in 2020? Perhaps you are a busy parent looking for an organization you and your children can support together. Maybe you are a working professional with a love for jogging? I urge you to consider Neuro Assistance Foundation as an organization worth supporting in the coming year.<br>

Our two largest fundraising events are 5K/10K races that are fun for the whole family and draw crowds of several hundreds! It's a great opportunity to spread the word about your organization, volunteer, or get out for a fun day. We hope to see you at the Cinco de Mayo or the Hot Hatch Chile Race!</p>

<h3>2019 Year-End Statistics</h3>

<p>
At this time of the year we like to take a look back to see who we helped this year. Take a look!<br>

201 clients - A 38% increase from last year!

Our youngest client was one year old - we actually had 2 one-year old clients: Samantha and Abby. Both girls have spina bifida and are receiving clean catheters from NAF.

Our oldest client was 78 year-old Willie, who received vehicle assistance after a spinal cord injury from a fall at home.

Motor vehicle accidents continue to be the leading cause of paralysis for our clients with over 50% of our clients having been in some type of accident with a car, truck, motorcycle or ATV.

Mobility equipment continues to be the most requested form of assistance. This category includes wheelchairs, repairs on chairs, hospital beds, complex shower chairs and lifts.</p>
